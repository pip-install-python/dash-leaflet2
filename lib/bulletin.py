"""Network bulletin — hub-published tips and announcements.

NETWORK FILE: copied from dash-email, which took it from
dash-documentation-boilerplate 1.2.4. Only ``app_id()`` differs, and it is
derived rather than typed — see the note there, because this repo is the one
where the obvious import is wrong twice over.

The hub (2plot.dev) serves one JSON document at ``/api/network/bulletin`` and
every satellite renders it in the header of its llms.txt viewer. That is the
whole point: a twenty-site network says "here is what changed" once, in one
place, instead of in twenty repositories that immediately drift.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS RATHER THAN FOUR LINES IN run.py
-----------------------------------------------------
On the boilerplate it WAS four lines in ``run.py``, and they were **commented
out** — with a note saying the hub did not serve the endpoint yet. The hub
started serving it, the comment did not change, and ``NETWORK_BULLETIN_URL``
was set in production for a while against code that never read it. Nothing
failed: ``configure_bulletin`` is opt-in, so an unwired app makes no request
and the viewer header renders perfectly well with the package's built-in
defaults. The only symptom was an announcement that never appeared, which is
not a symptom anyone notices.

So the wiring is a function that returns whether it wired, ``run.py`` prints
that, and ``tests/test_bulletin.py`` exercises it directly — no commented-out
code, and a boot log line that says which of the two states you are in.

Env:
    NETWORK_BULLETIN_URL   the hub endpoint. Absent -> feature off, silently.
    NETWORK_BULLETIN_TTL_S seconds a cached bulletin stays fresh (default 900)

    retired for the tracker/reporter/rollup trio — so the key this app
    announces itself with and the key it reports traffic under cannot drift
    apart (both read ``SATELLITE_APP_KEY``). A satellite left announcing
    itself as "boilerplate" would receive the template's announcements, and
    the hub's "who is rendering the bulletin" view would count it as that
    repo.

    ONE IMPORT THAT LOOKS RIGHT AND IS NOT: ``AD_APP_ID`` is the ad network's
    identifier, historically the long ``dash-leaflet2``, whereas the directory
    key is ``leaflet``. Announcing the long form would file this host under a
    name the hub's directory does not use.
