"""/terms and /privacy — the Legal section (1.6.44 item 15).

Two pages, one shape each: a SINGLE markdown string that is both what the
browser renders and what the machine lane is handed as `llms_doc`. That is the
whole point of the shape — a site whose privacy page says one thing to a
reader and another to a crawler has TWO privacy policies, and only one of them
was reviewed.

The privacy text is GENERATED FROM THE MECHANISM, not from a template. Every
claim in it is a claim about code in this repository, and
`tests/test_legal_pages.py` holds the two together by reading a REAL visit row
and asserting every key in it is described here. If the tracker starts storing
something this page does not mention, the test goes red rather than the page
going quietly false.

BUILT AFTER ITEM 16, deliberately. The page states what the tracker stores
*after* the privacy work — no raw address, no third-party lookup, location
from the edge. A fork that writes this page first publishes prose about a
mechanism it does not have.

## What this site is

{SITE_SHORT_NAME} is documentation, published by {PUBLISHER}. It documents a
component library that wraps **Leaflet {LEAFLET_VERSION}** for Dash, and the
live examples on it are demonstrations of that library. It is reference
material: it is not advice, it is not a service, and nothing on it is a
commitment to keep any particular behaviour working in your project.

Leaflet 2 is itself an **alpha**. This library tracks it, so the components
documented here will change while it does, and pages describing them may
describe a version you are not running.

## The documentation and the code in it

The prose and the code examples are published so you can read them, run them
and copy them. The source repository states the licence the code is offered
under, and that licence — not this page — is what governs your use of it:

- [{GITHUB_URL}]({GITHUB_URL})

Everything here is offered **as is**, without warranty of any kind. Running a
code example against your own data, in your own deployment, is your decision
and your responsibility. The maps on this site load tiles from third-party
providers under their own terms; the attribution shown on each map names them.

## Accounts

Some pages may be gated behind a sign-in. An account exists so the site can
tell whether you may see a page; it is not a subscription and carries no
entitlement. Accounts may be ended at any time, by you or by us, and the
[Privacy](/privacy) page describes what is kept while one exists.

## Links to other sites

This site links to other sites in the 2plot network, to Leaflet's own
documentation, and to third-party projects. Those sites have their own terms
and their own privacy practices, and this page does not speak for them.

## Changes

These terms change when the site does. The change history for the whole site,
including this page, is the [Changelog](/changelog) and the repository's commit
history — there is no separate archive of previous versions, because the
repository already is one.

## Contact

PRIVACY_DOC = f"""# Privacy

> {PRIVACY_DESCRIPTION}

This page describes what the code in this repository actually does. Each claim
below corresponds to something readable in `lib/analytics_tracker.py`, and the
test suite holds the two together: a key that appears in a stored row and not
on this page fails the build.

## What is stored about a visit

Every request that is not network machinery records one row:

- the **time** of the request;
- the **path** requested;
- a **device type** (desktop, mobile, tablet, bot);
- the **User-Agent** string your browser or client sent;
- a **visitor key** — a keyed one-way hash of your network address and
  User-Agent, truncated, used to tell one visitor from another within the
  retention window;
- a **location**, if and only if the network edge in front of this site sent
  one (see below).

Crawler rows additionally carry the vendor identity the classifier
determined — which bot it was, and whether it verified.

## What is NOT stored

- **Your IP address.** It is read from the request so the site can tell one
  visitor from another, and then reduced to the visitor key and discarded. It
  is not written to disk. (An operator running their own copy of this
  repository can set `ANALYTICS_KEEP_CLIENT_IP=1` to keep it. This site does
  not.)
- **Anything from a third-party lookup service.** Earlier versions of this
  site sent visitor addresses to a geolocation API over plain HTTP. That code
  was **removed** — not disabled — in release 1.6.44. This app makes no
  outbound request about you.
- **Cookies for analytics.** The visitor key is computed per request from what
  your client already sent. Nothing is stored in your browser to track you.
  Signing in sets a session cookie, which is what keeps you signed in.

## Where location comes from

From the network edge, or not at all. Cloudflare sits in front of this site and
adds headers describing where a request entered its network: `CF-IPCountry`
always, and `CF-IPCity`, `CF-Region`, `CF-IPLatitude` and `CF-IPLongitude` when
the zone is configured to send them. Whatever arrives is stored; whatever does
not is simply absent. There is no lookup and no fallback to one.

You can see which of those headers this host is actually receiving — they are
listed in the `geo.headers_seen` field of
[{BASE_URL}/healthz]({BASE_URL}/healthz).

## The maps on this site

The examples render real maps, which means your browser fetches map tiles
directly from the tile provider shown in each map's attribution. Those requests
go from your browser to that provider and are subject to their privacy policy,
not this one. This site does not proxy them and does not see them.

## Network machinery is counted nowhere

The 2plot network's own traffic — health checks, deploy batteries, link
audits — carries a marker in its User-Agent and is dropped before anything is
recorded. It is not in these numbers, by design.

## How long it is kept, and where it goes

Rows are pruned on a retention window and the file is capped in size. A daily
summary — counts by day, by page, by country, by crawler vendor — is sent to
the 2plot network hub. The summary carries no visitor keys, no addresses and no
User-Agent strings: it is counts.

## Signing in

Sign-in is handled by Clerk. What Clerk stores about an account is governed by
Clerk's own privacy policy. This site keeps the identifier it needs to decide
what you may see.
