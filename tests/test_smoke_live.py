"""Exercise scripts/smoke_live.py against the app itself.

The script only ever runs in CD, against a host that already exists, which is
exactly the kind of code that rots unnoticed — a typo in a regex turns every
check into a silent pass and CD keeps reporting green over a broken deploy.
So it gets run here too, with its `fetch` pointed at the in-process app
instead of the network.
